# grph₵enter - Build Graphs and Graph Algorithms

## Description
This project is a web application that provides a visual simulation of graph algorithms and allows users to construct graphs based on provided data. It visualizes graph algorithms in an interactive and graphical manner.

## Key Features
- Support for finding the "MST - Minimum Spanning Tree" on weighted graphs.
- Shortest path problem with BFS (unweighted graph), dijikastra (weighted graph)
- Check the existence of a Hamiltonian Cycle in a graph.
- Perform graph traversal using DFS and BFS.
- ...

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind/CSS**: For styling and layout design.
- **TypeScript**: The main programming language.
